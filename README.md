# Waste-compactor-Smart-Dustbin
 We are making a smart dustbin which can solve the problem of overflowing bins, save a lot of fuel which is used for collection of waste from different bins around the city as well as segregate waste right where it is collected. The bins will be solar powered and won’t take any electricity from the grid. However, for indoors a hybrid model can be created which is capable of using both AC supply as well as solar power.   The proposed dustbin will have two sections namely the “Recycling unit” and the “Compaction unit”. The recycling unit will have two separate openings for wastes like bottles &amp; cans and for paper waste (only clean paper which can be recycled). This way plastic bottles, metallic cans and paper waste will already be separated from the garbage. The compaction unit will be used for all the other kinds of waste. The special thing about the compaction unit is that it can contain upto 5 to 8 times more waste than an ordinary dustbin. This will be achieved through compaction. Compressing the trash is an age old idea in the waste management world but in our country, so far no technique is used to compress the garbage right where it is thrown by you and me. Our solution involves compressing waste right where it is collected. The motor of the compressor will be run through a battery charged by the sun. This way it won’t consume any power from the grid and the dustbin can be installed anywhere.
